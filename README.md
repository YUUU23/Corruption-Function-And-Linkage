# Corruption-Function-And-Linkage

This repository contains corruption function with example datasets (original and corrupted) and corruption analysis with similarity matrices. 

**BlockingFunction.R**: stores functions for dividing dataset into blocks randomly 
- df_to_block_equal : split dataset randomly into n-equal-sized blocks 


**DataCorruptionFunctions.R** : stores functions used to corrupt one data-value 
- rand_norm : generates random int in desired range with normal distribution *helper func.* 
- corr_num_by_range: corrupt continous values by changing it to random integer within desired range generated by rand_norm 
- corr_missing_val: corrupt values by changing to NA; if value is already NA, do nothing. Require data-frame null representation to be NA 
- corr_zero_nine_number: corrupt by changing values [0-9] into random integer [0-9] (uniform distribution) 
- corr_del_letter: corrupt value stored as string by deleteing random letter in value (normal distribution) 
- corr_add_letter: corrupt value stored as string by appending random letter (uniform distribution) to random position in string (normal distribution) 


**CorruptionFunctionWithProbability.R** : functions to apply corruption function in DataCorruptionFunctions.R to data-frame columns with beta distribution probability; corruption can be applied to multiple blocks or single data-frame (use block size n=1 for all functions) 

- corr_single_block: corrupts a single block with given probability and function *helper func.*
- corr_fun_prob: generates vector of probability (desired beta distribution) denoting probability that corruption function is applied to each block
- block_corr_general: corrupting vector of block where the degree of corruption remains constant
- corr_num_range_degree: generate random degree of corruption (range) to be used in corr_num_by_range (uniform distribution) 
- block_corr_with_degree: corrupting vector of block where the degree of corruption varies block to block (i.e. corr_num_by_range)
